**Slash mobs** is a game about you fightning against monsters, getting coins, leveling up and buying new weapons to train better and easier. 

The game gives players around 3-4 types (may include more) of monsters to fight. 
Each time a monster is killed/defeated the player level is increased by the indicated amount of exp that type of monster gives. Each mob drops some money after being defeated. The player can use this money to buy new weapons from the shop

**There is no objective for this game.** The only thing you need to be aware of is those strong monsters!
